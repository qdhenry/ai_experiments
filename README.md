# AI Prompts Collection

This project contains a collection of system prompts, role definitions, and related configuration files for various AI personas or specialized modes. These files are designed to configure AI models to adopt specific roles and expertise during interactions.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into directories, each representing a distinct AI persona or function:

*   **`agents/`**: Contains examples or configurations for agent interactions. Includes:
    *   `copy-writer-to-designer-handoff.example.md`: An example illustrating a handoff process between a copywriter and a designer agent.
*   **`human-engineering/`**: Contains resources related to prompt engineering or designing human-AI interactions. Includes:
    *   `psuedo-algo.ts`: Potentially TypeScript logic or algorithms related to prompt structuring or processing.
    *   `ramble-to-wisdom.system.xml`: An XML-based system prompt.
*   **`senior-ux-ui-designer/`**: Houses prompts and configurations for an AI acting as a Senior UX/UI Designer. Includes:
    *   `prompt.md`: A Markdown-formatted prompt.
    *   `prompt.xml`: An XML-formatted prompt.
*   **`senior-website-copywriter/`**: Includes definitions and prompts for an AI specialized in website copywriting. Includes:
    *   `role-definition.txt`: A text file defining the copywriter role.
    *   `system-prompt.xml`: An XML-based system prompt for this role.

## Usage

These files can be used as system messages, initial instructions, or configuration inputs when working with large language models (LLMs) or AI systems to guide their behavior and responses according to the defined personas.
